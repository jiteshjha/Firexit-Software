					A cookie is a small text file that we transfer to your computer and/or device, to identify a user's computer/device and to remember things about your visit, such as your preferences or a username and password.

You can disable cookies at any time, although you may not be able to access or use features of the Service. We may feature advertisements served by third parties that deliver cookies to your computer/device so the content you access and advertisements you see can be tracked. Since the third party advertising companies associate your computer/device with a number, they will be able to recognize your computer/device each time they send you an advertisement. These advertisers may use information about your visits to our Service and third party sites and applications in order to measure advertisement performance and to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for the data collection practices of these third party advertisers, and we encourage you to check their privacy policies to learn more about their use of cookies and other technology.

					Our services may contain third party tracking tools from our service providers, examples of which may include InAppFuel, Flurry, GameAnalytics, Tapjoy, and others.

The third parties may have access to information such as your device identifier, Media Access Control (“MAC“) address, International Mobile Equipment Identity (“IMEI“), locale (specific location where a given language is spoken), geo-location information, and IP address.
					</p><p>
					Ad Networks
					</p><p>
					We may feature advertising within our Service. The advertisers may collect and use information about you, such as your Service session activity, device identifier, MAC address, IMEI, geo-location information and IP address.
